Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Introduction:
This project focuses on implementing image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are deep learning models specifically designed for analyzing visual data such as images.

Requirements:
1. Python (version 3.x recommended)
2. TensorFlow or PyTorch (for building and training the CNN)
3. NumPy (for numerical computations)
4. Matplotlib (for visualization)
5. Dataset: You'll need a dataset of labeled images for training and testing your model. Popular datasets include MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, etc.

Installation:
1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install TensorFlow or PyTorch by following the instructions on their respective websites.
3. Install NumPy, Matplotlib, and any other required libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

Usage:
1. Data Preparation: Obtain and preprocess your dataset. This typically involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, resizing images, normalizing pixel values, etc.
   
2. Model Building:Design your CNN architecture. This includes defining the number of convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, activation functions, and output layer. You can experiment with different architectures to find the best one for your task.

3. Training: Train your CNN on the training dataset. Use an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD) and loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy, binary cross-entropy) for your classification task. Monitor the training process for metrics such as accuracy, loss, etc.

4. Evaluation:Evaluate the performance of your trained model on the testing dataset. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., to assess the model's performance.

5. Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen images. Process the images similarly to the training data (resize, normalize) before feeding them into the model for prediction.
